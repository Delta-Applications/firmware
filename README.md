This is a collection of apps, that could be applied to more or only the Utility category, for example, Weather, a QR Reader, a modern version of Wallace Toolbox,
a custom FM Radio that doesn't require headphones, a custom SMS app that could integrate with Signal, etcetera, all of these apps should follow the style of KaiOS,
with a simple message: "Do not Sue me".
