[![Project Status: Concept â€“ Minimal or no implementation has been done yet, or the repository is only intended to be a limited example, demo, or proof-of-concept.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/concept.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#concept)  

-- PERSONAL COLLECTION OF MANTAINED, UNMANTAINEND AND MODIFIED APPLICATIONS --

This is a collection of apps, that could be applied to more or only the Utility category, for example, Weather, a QR Reader, a modern version of Wallace Toolbox,
a custom FM Radio that doesn't require headphones, etc.

## Roadmap

### Utility
Utility applications that could or already fit the purpose of the Utility folder in KaiOS 3.0

- Open Source FM Radio identical to Stock without need of headphones (just detect if an antenna is available, instead of checking if headphones are plugged in)

- Open Source Bugfixed Clock Application that can display the time with different styles (eg. digital clock, vintage) on homepage and also follow timezones and display those in a grid, while still having the other functionality as alarm clock, timer and stopwatch

### Messagistic

Messagistic Based Apps (delta.chat, IRC, SMS, Whatsapp, Signal) that would cause bloatware, could be stored in a Messagistics/Communication folder, similiar to Carrier, but for messagistic applications, and bloatware apps such as Signal, Whatsapp, or IRC could be made downloadable, while delta.chat could be integrated with SMS App.  
What could be used to achieve the SMS App message style would be to firstly make an opensoure version similiar to SMS App, and then write appropriate styling and scripts to create integrations that will use the basic functions to create, delete, and transform messages.

- Alerts Application that grabs SMS Alerts like always, but also grabs Weather alerts from Accuweather when online and keeps them for a week

- Email Messages Application (delta chat) [Similiar to email app, but when logged in will work similiarly to SMS app, but instead of using telephone numbers, contacts with an email will be used]
