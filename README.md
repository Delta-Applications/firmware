[![Project Status: Concept â€“ Minimal or no implementation has been done yet, or the repository is only intended to be a limited example, demo, or proof-of-concept.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/concept.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#concept)  
This is a collection of apps, that could be applied to more or only the Utility category, for example, Weather, a QR Reader, a modern version of Wallace Toolbox,
a custom FM Radio that doesn't require headphones, a custom SMS app that could integrate with Signal, etcetera, all of these apps should follow the style of KaiOS,
with a simple message: "Do not Sue me".
